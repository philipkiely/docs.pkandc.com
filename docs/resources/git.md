# Git

When I was in high school, I had a fairly standard workflow for writing essays. I would open a Microsoft Word document, write the essay, and save it as something along the lines of `Essay Rough Draft.docx`. After turning in the rough draft to the teacher, revisions went in `Essay Draft 2.docx`. I then sent that file to my mother, who replied with a file I called `Essay Ma Edits.docx`. The final essay was turned in as `Essay Final.docx`. A later revision might live in `Essay Final For Real.docx`.

This inelegant workflow exposes two needs: collaboration and version control. Git, via GitHub, provides us with both. Through a series of **commits**, we can make changes to the same file and have a record of those changes. Through **pull requests** we can introduce changes to each other's work.

## Learning Git

Git is a command-line tool with a handful of commands to master. Once you have developed a basic familiarity with the tool, you may find yourself applying it outside of PK&C projects to track your personal work.

Keep handy this [list of common git commands](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/#basic-git), but don't try to read it to get started. Instead, review the recipes below to see how they apply in daily work.
