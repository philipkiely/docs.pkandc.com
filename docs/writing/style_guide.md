# Style Guide

This style guide covers common use cases and company-specific policy. For all other style queries, refer to The Chicago Manual of Style, 16th or 17th edition. For technical terms, industry-standard style practices should override the Chicago guidelines.

## Abbreviation

### Company Abbreviations

Abbreviate "Philip Kiely & Company" to "PK&C" or "the Company." Abbreviate "Writing for Software Developers" to "WfSD" and "Cold Email to Interesting People" to "CEfIP" only when absolutely necessary publicly (for example, a tweet), but prefer it internally.

### Semantic Versioning of Edits and Releases

Use standard semantic versioning notation when noting edits and release versions of documents and publications; that is, the major release number, minor release number, and edit number separated by periods. In the context of written material:

* major releases occur when the material is distributed or published,
* minor releases occur when the material is restructured or authors and contributors are added or removed, and
* edits occur whenever any part of the material is changed in a way that does not affect the overall structure of the material.

## Capitalization

### Academic Departments

Lowercase all academic departments except for those named after proper nouns (usually only languages fit this criteria)

*Example: I’m interested in majoring in anthropology and Spanish, with a possible minor in Asian-American studies.*

### Capitalization after Colons

Capitalize the word after a colon only if the colon encompasses a quote or multiple sentences.

*Example: I heard it today: they are closing the bakery on Main Street. / It’s very clear: It was Steve’s fault. Moira was not involved. / The new CEO said this: "I have great hopes for this company."*

### Companies and Celebrities

Follow the individual or organization’s stated preference when capitalizing or stylizing the names of businesses, products, and famous people.

*Example: In AP Computer Science last year I learned HTML and JavaScript. / I want to work at DreamWorks or Microsoft. / My favorite poets are e e cummings, Walt Whitman, bell hooks, and MF DOOM.*

### Compound Adjectives

If a compound adjective forms part of an otherwise capitalized phrase, like a headline or book title, capitalize all words making up the compound.

*Example: A Beginner’s Guide to Front-End Development*

### Titles and Honorifics

Titles and honorifics (president, general, princess) are capitalized only when they are attached to the name of a person who holds the title. On their own, they are lowercase.

*Example: The president and the first lady walked on the lawn. / President Joe Biden and his wife, First Lady Jill Biden, walked down the lawn.*

### Titles of Published Works and Webpages

Capitalize the first and last word, all nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adjectives, and subordinate conjunctions (i.e. than, whether, after, because, since, so that, etc.). Lowercase all articles (a, an, the) and coordinating conjunctions (but, for, nor, and) unless they are the first or last word of the title.

### Race and Ethnicity

Capitalize nationalities (Samoan, Spanish, Italian, Chinese) and ethnicities (Asian, South American, Latino/a). Capitalize "Black" when referring to race. Do not capitalize "white" when referring to race.

## Grammar

### Beginning Sentences with Conjunctions

It is allowable and sometimes even advisable to begin the occasional sentence with a conjunction ("and," "but") as a way of maintaining a "snappy" journalistic tone. While The Chicago Manual of Style is ambivalent on this use, PK&C encourages it.

### Generic Pronouns

Use "they" as a generic pronoun for people whose pronouns are not known and in hypothetical scenarios; do not use "he or she" or "s/he".

*Example: The user may benefit from doing their own reading of the manual.*

### Oxford/Serial Comma

When listing more than two items in a comma-separated series, always place a comma before the "and" preceding the last item.

*Example: Philip Kiely & Co has a website with a range of resources, including publications, published articles, and contact information.*

## Punctuation

### Ampersands

Use ampersands instead of "and" in titles and abbreviations (i.e. "PK&C, not PK and C) unless using "and" is necessary for some reason, such as in a URL.

### Contractions

Use contractions at personal discretion in articles, blog posts, and tweets. In published material (anything published as a PDF) contract all phrases containing "is," "am," "are," and "not" (individual writers and editors may choose to deviate from this rule on a case-by-case basis).

### Hyphenation

Place a hyphen between nouns that make up a compound adjective that comes before another noun.

*Example: work-study grant / back-end development / soon-to-be-defunct practice*

### Possessives

Use an apostrophe followed by an "s" to indicate possession for all single nouns (including nouns ending in "s"). For plural nouns, use only an apostrophe.

*Example: The student’s backpack / Mr. Connors’s home / The trees’ leaves*

### Quotation Marks

Punctuation always goes inside quotation marks, even if the quoted matter does not include punctuation (i.e. when listing quoted items, the commas separating the items go inside the quotation marks). When quoting text with a dialogue tag afterwords (i.e. "the programmer wrote," "said Dan Jones"), use a comma at the end of the quote unless the quoted matter ends in an exclamation point or question mark. 

*Note: It may not be possible to follow this guideline when quoting lines of code. Always prioritize the ability to copy and paste code and have it run properly over conforming to any punctuation style.*

*Example: The critic called the show "ingenious," "innovative," and "inspiring." / Mrs. Smith said, "I don’t think this is a good idea." / "I don’t think this is a good idea," Mrs. Smith said. / "Did you hear about the new style rules?" the editor asked.*

## Quotation and Citation

### Citing in Books

When citing articles (academic or otherwise) and other published texts in PK&C books, use the Chicago 16th edition notes and bibliography style.

### Citing in Website Pages and Posts

For most sales pages, blog posts, and other informal postings, a simple inline link or hyperlink to the source will suffice. Defer to the "Citing in Books" policy for long-form formal articles posted on the Company website.

### Styling Citations

When referencing a book, journal, or news periodical, italicize the name of the text. In all other cases, place the name of the text within quotation marks.

## Miscellaneous

### Profanity

In the relatively rare instance that it is necessary to use profanity in a PK&C publication or webpage, do not censor letters out of the profane words (i.e. write "shit," not "sh*t.") Do not use profanity on YouTube.
