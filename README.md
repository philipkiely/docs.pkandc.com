## Copyright Notice

I believe in working in public. I have learned a great deal from other companies and founders who have chosen to make their operations transparent, and I hope to continue that practice in my own company. However, the contents of this repository (the words, not the code, which is licensed separately) are copyright Philip Kiely & Company. Feel free to read and learn from them but re-publishing any major portion of them is still a copyright violation, please don't do that. If you are from a sufficiently large company that vaguely worded copyright notices like this make your lawyers nervous, feel free to send me an email to ask for written permission to do whatever it is you want to do with these pages.
